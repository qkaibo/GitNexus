/**
 * B2 — a refresh that reports SUCCESS while leaving the index unusable.
 *
 * The dangerous variant of a broken refresh: metadata IS written, so the index
 * reads as fresh, hooks re-arm, and every tool answers from a graph missing
 * most of its edges — which is indistinguishable from a codebase that
 * genuinely has no such relationships. Observed as edges collapsing
 * 23009 -> 2170, and as a `CodeRelation` table that never materialized (which
 * reads back as a persisted count of zero).
 *
 * `analyze` compares the relationship count the pipeline produced against what
 * the DB hands back after the write and records `graphWriteCollapsed`. This
 * covers the translation of that record into the operator-facing reason, which
 * is what `status` and the MCP resources report.
