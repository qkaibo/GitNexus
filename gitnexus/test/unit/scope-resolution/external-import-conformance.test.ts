/**
 * One property, asserted for EVERY registered `ScopeResolver` (#2953).
 *
 *   A specifier that names something OUTSIDE the repository must not resolve to
 *   a file inside it.
 *
 * This is the property #2953 was filed against. Its violation is not a missing
 * edge but a fabricated one: `@acme/telemetry/nest` resolving to the repo's
 * only path ending in `nest/index.ts` produces an `IMPORTS` edge at full
 * confidence between two files that have no relationship, and `impact` then
 * reports a blast radius into code that cannot be affected. The reporter
 * measured 44 of 74 cross-package edges landing on two such files.
 *
 * The mechanism is shared, which is why this file is: `import-resolvers/
 * utils.ts:suffixResolve` asks "does any file in this repo have a path ending
 * in this specifier?", retrying with each leading segment dropped, and most
 * languages still end their resolution chain there.
 *
 * ## The decoy is the whole test
 *
 * Every case pairs an external specifier with a DECOY — an unrelated in-repo
 * file whose path ends the way the specifier does. Without one, a resolver that
 * simply found nothing would pass while still holding no property at all: the
 * question is not "did it return null" but "did it return null when a tempting
 * wrong answer was sitting in the file set". Each case therefore also asserts
 * the decoy is genuinely reachable, by resolving the spelling that SHOULD find
 * it, so a typo in a fixture cannot manufacture a pass.
 *
 * ## `KNOWN_GAPS` is a work list, not an allowance
 *
 * A language in that map does not hold the property today. The entry records
 * what its resolver currently answers, so the follow-up that fixes it deletes
 * one line and the arm below starts enforcing it. Both arms run for every
 * language either way — a gap that silently closes fails just as loudly as one
 * that opens, because a resolver quietly starting to answer `null` for the
 * paired positive case is a regression wearing the fix's clothes.

/**
 * The six that hold it, and what earns each one.
 *
 * Not a list to maintain by hand — it is derived below — but worth reading

 * generalizes:
 *
 *   - TypeScript / JavaScript / Vue resolve against declared config only and
 *     have no suffix fallback at all (#2953). This is the shape the ten above
 *     need.
 *   - Python (#898) and C# (#1881) kept the fallback and put a gate in front of
 *     it, keyed on whether the specifier's leading segment names anything
 *     in-repo. Cheaper, and it holds — but it is a filter on a guess rather
 *     than a resolution rule, so it answers "probably not external" instead of
 *     "here is what the language says this means".
 *   - Rust holds it for a spelling reason: `::` is not `/` or `.`, so
 *     `serde::de` never decomposes into a path suffix that could match
 *     `src/de.rs`. The decoy-reachability arm proves the file IS reachable via
 *     `crate::de`, so this is a real pass — but it is contingent on the
 *     separator, not on Rust knowing what a crate is.
