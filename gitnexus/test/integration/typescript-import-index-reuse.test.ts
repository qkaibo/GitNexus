/**
 * Production-path regression guard for the TypeScript import-resolution pass
 * cache (#2910).
 *
 * `makeTsResolveImportTarget` has carried a `SuffixIndex` since #1918, so the
 * per-import rebuild this file's siblings were written for never applied here.
 * What did apply is the OTHER failure mode of the memo it used: a single slot,
 * invalidated by `cached.key !== allFilePaths`. One file set is memoized
 * perfectly; two alternating file sets rebuild the arrays, the index and the
 * `resolveCache` on every single call. Measured at 4000 files × 400 imports:
 * 12.0 ms for one set, 1438.2 ms alternating between two — 120x, and the same
 * O(imports × files) shape the per-file-set index hoists removed.
 *
 * That is why this adapter could not carry `expectDistinctFileSetsGetOwnIndex`,
 * the one arm every other language's guard has: the arm alternates two sets by
 * construction, and the single-slot cache posts 42 traversals against the 2 it
 * posts now. The cache is a `WeakMap<ReadonlySet<string>, PassCache>` keyed on
 * the Set, like every other language's index, and the arm below is the proof.
 *
 * Whether the thrash was reachable in production: `pipeline/run.ts` builds one
 * `allFilePaths` Set per provider pass and TypeScript, JavaScript and Vue are
 * separate providers with separate caches, so within one analyze it was latent
 * rather than live. It was one refactor — an interleaved or re-entrant pass, a
 * second workspace, a caller resolving against a filtered file set — away from
 * live, and the `WeakMap` is strictly simpler than the slot it replaces.
 *
 * Resolution goes through `typescriptScopeResolver.resolveImportTarget`, the
 * orchestrator adapter, which must pass the Set THROUGH: a defensive
 * `new Set(allFilePaths)` hands a fresh `WeakMap` key per import and restores
 * the per-import rebuild (PR #1918 review P1). Two traversals per file set, not
 * one: the adapter materializes `allFileList` and then keeps one mutable copy
 * of the Set, because `TsResolveContext.allFilePaths` is a `Set`, not a
 * `ReadonlySet`.
 *
 * The counts are paired with result assertions on purpose: a count of 2 is
 * equally true of an adapter that has stopped resolving anything at all.
