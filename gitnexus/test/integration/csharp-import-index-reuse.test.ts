/**
 * Production-path regression guard for the C# import-resolution indexes (#2878).
 *
 * The no-csproj `using` path reads TWO per-file-set indexes, each memoized on
 * the `allFilePaths` Set identity via its own WeakMap: the shared
 * `getWorkspaceFileIndex` (`import-resolvers/workspace-file-index.ts`, used by
 * both the csproj and no-csproj legs) and `getCsharpDirIndex`
 * (`languages/csharp/import-target.ts`, the namespace-directory index behind
 * `firstFileDirectlyInPkgDir`). A four-segment `using` used to cost up to eight
 * full workspace passes.
 *
 * Resolution reaches both through `csharpScopeResolver.resolveImportTarget` —
 * the orchestrator adapter — not by calling `resolveCsharpImportTarget`
 * directly the way the unit parity test does. The adapter must therefore pass
 * the Set THROUGH; a defensive copy (`new Set(allFilePaths)`) would hand a
 * fresh WeakMap key per call and rebuild BOTH indexes on every `using`,
 * restoring the O(usings × files) behaviour this replaced. Python hit exactly
 * that (PR #1918 review P1), and the parity test cannot see it: it never
 * crosses the adapter.
 *
 * C# is also the reason the counting instrument has to be a real `Set`
 * subclass: `narrowContext` rejects a workspace context whose `allFilePaths`
 * fails `instanceof Set`, and a rejected context resolves nothing — every
 * assertion would then pass on `null === null`.
 *
 * The traversal-count assertions are the perf guard. They are paired with
 * result assertions on purpose: a count of 2 is equally true of an adapter that
 * has stopped resolving anything at all, so counting alone would stay green
 * while every C# IMPORTS edge disappeared.
