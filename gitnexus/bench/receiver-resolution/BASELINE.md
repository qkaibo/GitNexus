## U7 — the go/no-go gate: PASS

A/B produced by reverting ONLY the fold wiring (`compound-receiver.ts` +
`receiver-bound-calls.ts`) to the pre-U10 commit and rebuilding, so capture
emission — and therefore the persisted bytes — is identical in both arms and the
delta isolates the fold. Build + both caches wiped before every run (KTD4).

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Δ | Threshold | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| scope-resolution wall-clock, median of 3 | 25470.0 ms | 25687.9 ms | +0.86% | ≤ +3% | **PASS** |
| wall-clock, slowest of 3 | 25520.0 ms | 25832.6 ms | +1.22% | ≤ +5% p95 | **PASS** |
| serialized bytes per emitting site | — | **35.2 B** | — | ≤ 48 B | **PASS** |
| persisted store growth | 1 234 600 B | 1 235 340 B | **+0.0599%** | ≤ 3% | **PASS** |
| retained chain payload | — | 740 B | — | ≤ 6 MB | **PASS** |
| call drops (no regression) | 99 | 99 | 0 | no new drops | **PASS** |
| peak RSS | — | — | — | ≤ +2% | **NOT RESOLVABLE** |

**The 35.2 B result confirms KTD7 by measurement rather than by assertion.** The
48-byte threshold was set deliberately so the object encoding (~71 B predicted)
fails and the compact string (~35 B predicted) passes. Measured: 35.2 B,
including the JSON key and quotes. The encoding decision is now evidence-backed.

**Peak RSS: the threshold is below this instrument's resolution, so it is
reported as unresolvable rather than as a pass or a fail.** Three *independent*
treatment runs with the code held constant gave 414.9 / 436.6 / 436.9 MB — a
5.3% spread, wider than the ±2% being tested. (An earlier pair of 3-reps-in-one-
process runs read 536 vs 551 MB and looked like a +2.77% regression; that was
heap accumulating across reps, not growth.) Corroborating argument that no growth
exists to find: the change persists 740 bytes across the entire corpus and the
fold allocates nothing retained — it returns `SymbolDefinition`s the indexes
already hold.

**Fold hit-rate.** Chains are minted for 21 of 529 TypeScript reference sites
(4.0%) — the field costs nothing on the 96% of sites with a bare-name receiver.
On the shape corpus, all 5 chain-carrying shapes resolve, so the fold is not pure
added cost on this population.

**Not measured: a dedicated synthetic miss-dominant scaling corpus.** The plan
asks for `scaling_ratio < 1.5` on one, on the grounds that a same-name corpus
hits at `ownerChain[0]` and never exercises the MRO tail. Stated plainly so it is
not mistaken for a silent pass. What bounds the cost instead: the fold runs with
`fieldFallback: false`, so the O(fields × depth × names) path the threshold exists
to police cannot execute at all, and the remaining work is at most
`MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH` (3) map lookups per MRO ancestor per chained site, over a
population of 21 sites. The wall-clock A/B above is the empirical check on that
reasoning.

Measured with `bench/receiver-resolution/measure.mjs` on `f87b2cbe`.

Hygiene (a run without both steps is void — `analyze --force` clears neither cache,
and the parse worker runs from `dist/`):

```
npm run build
rm -rf .gitnexus/parse-cache .gitnexus/parsedfile-cache
node --import tsx bench/receiver-resolution/measure.mjs --corpus test/fixtures/lang-resolution
```

Two consecutive runs were byte-identical, not merely within noise.

## Count arm — `test/fixtures/lang-resolution`

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Call drops (the gate number)** | **99** |
| Total drops, all site kinds | 124 |
| Split by site kind | `call: 99`, `read: 25` |

Call drops by extension:

| ext | n | ext | n | ext | n |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.java` | 49 | `.py` | 5 | `.rs` | 3 |
| `.cs` | 8 | `.go` | 5 | `.kt` | 3 |
| `.ts` | 7 | `.cpp` | 5 | `.rb` | 2 |
| `.tsx` | 6 | `.php` | 4 | `.js` | 1 |
| | | | | `.swift` | 1 |

**Why the split matters (KTD6 defect 1, now measured).** 25 of the 124 drops — 20% —
are property *reads*, not lost calls. Case 0's recorder gates on the receiver's
punctuation, not on what the reference is, so `d.source.kind` lands in the same
bucket as a dropped method call. Gating on the unsplit 124 would have measured a
population one fifth of which this work does not target.

## Shape arm

`RESOLVES` means an edge exists — **not** that it points at the right target. A
name-keyed fallback onto a same-named member reads as `RESOLVES`, so a shape whose
receiver has no well-defined type is not a usable control.

| Language | Shape | State | siteKind |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `svc.getUser().save()` | RESOLVES | — |
| TypeScript | `svc.getUser().address.save()` | RESOLVES | — |
| TypeScript | `svc?.getUser().save()` | **INVISIBLE-GAP** | — |
| TypeScript | `svc!.getUser().save()` | VISIBLE-GAP | `call` |
| TypeScript | `(await svc.getUserAsync()).save()` | VISIBLE-GAP | `call` |
| TypeScript | `svc.getTyped<User>().save()` | **INVISIBLE-GAP** | — |
| TypeScript | `repos[0].save()` | **INVISIBLE-GAP** | — |
| PHP | `$svc->getUser()->save()` | VISIBLE-GAP | `call` |
| PHP | `$this->repo->save()` (typed property) | RESOLVES | — |
| C++ | `svc->getUser()->save()` | **INVISIBLE-GAP** | — |
| C++ | `svc2.getUser()->save()` | RESOLVES | — |

## Corrections to the plan, forced by measurement

1. **Three target shapes are invisible, not one.** The plan records only
   `repos[0].save()` as unrecorded. Measured, `svc?.getUser().save()` and
   `svc.getTyped<User>().save()` are equally invisible: no edge and no drop.

   This is the load-bearing correction. A gate built on the call-drop count alone
   would move by **zero** when those three shapes are fixed, reading a working
   change as "no improvement" — the same false-negative hazard the plan flags for
   stale shards, arriving by a different route. Hence the shape arm: it is blind
   to nothing, because it asks about edge presence rather than about a recorder
   that has to have fired.

2. **Invisibility is NOT a capture-layer gap.** Measured directly against
   `emitTsScopeCaptures`, all five TypeScript shapes emit a full call match —
   `@reference.call.member`, `@reference.name`, and crucially
   `@reference.receiver`:

   | Shape | `@reference.receiver` |
   |---|---|
   | `svc?.getUser().save()` | `svc?.getUser()` |
   | `svc.getTyped<User>().save()` | `svc.getTyped<User>()` |
   | `repos[0].save()` | `repos[0]` |

   So a `ReferenceSite` exists for every one of them, and hanging a
   `receiverChain` field on `ReferenceSite` is a viable carrier for all of them.
   That was worth establishing before building on it.

   The drop suppression is therefore downstream of capture. For `repos[0]` the
   cause is known and matches the plan: the receiver has neither `.` nor `(`, so
   Case 0's gate never fires. For `?.` and `<T>` the receiver text satisfies the
   gate, so Case 0 *does* run and one of two things happens — the site was marked
   in `handledSites` by another case, or `resolveCompoundReceiverClass` returned a
   class on which the member was then not found, leaving
   `compoundReceiverUnresolved` false. Those are materially different defects and
   which one applies is **not yet determined**; it is the first thing U10 has to
   establish, since the second would mean the recorder under-reports by
   mis-attribution rather than by a gate.

   *(An earlier revision of this file asserted that these shapes produce no
   reference site at all. That was inferred from edge-and-drop absence and is
   disproven by the capture dump above.)*

3. **KTD6 defect 2 overstates the PHP blindness.** The claim is that Case 0's
   C-family punctuation test means PHP `->` receivers "never record a drop at
   all". Measured, `$svc->getUser()->save()` *is* recorded, because its receiver
   text `$svc->getUser()` contains `(` and satisfies the gate. And the plan's own
   example, `$this->repo->save()`, does not need recording — with a typed property
   it resolves. The genuine PHP gap is the call chain, and it is already visible.

4. **The C++ defect is the `->` base receiver specifically.** `svc->getUser()->save()`
   is invisible while `svc2.getUser()->save()` resolves. Same chain, same `->save()`
   tail — only the base differs. This is exactly why `cpp-chain-call/` has never
   caught it: that fixture uses the value `.` form, which works.

## Known blind spots

Every count here is a lower bound on a known-biased population, and any later delta
must be read against the same bias.

- Case 0's gate is a C-family punctuation test (`.` or `(`), so a receiver that is a
  plain property path (`$this->repo`, `a::b`) never reaches the recorder.
- `repos[0].save()` has neither `.` nor `(` in its receiver — same result.
- `?.` and explicit type arguments produce no reference site at all.

## U8 — per-language rollout

Emission moved into one shared helper
(`utils/receiver-chain-captures.ts`) and is wired into all 14 language
emitters. The helper is language-free (R6): its call gate reads the
`@reference.call.*` tag prefix, a vocabulary every language's `.scm` query
shares, rather than a per-language tag list. It is self-gating — a non-call
match, an absent receiver, or a chain with no nameable base all leave the match
untouched — so inserting the call before every `out.push(grouped)` is safe even
in the emitters that have three or four such paths.

| Language | Shape | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `svc?.getUser().save()` | INVISIBLE-GAP | **RESOLVES** |
| TypeScript | `svc!.getUser().save()` | VISIBLE-GAP | **RESOLVES** |
| TypeScript | `svc.getTyped<User>().save()` | INVISIBLE-GAP | **RESOLVES** |
| C++ | `svc->getUser()->save()` | INVISIBLE-GAP | **RESOLVES** |
| C++ | `svc2.getUser()->save()` (control) | RESOLVES | RESOLVES |
| PHP | `$svc->getUser()->save()` | VISIBLE-GAP | INVISIBLE-GAP |
| PHP | `$this->repo->save()` (control) | RESOLVES | RESOLVES |

The C++ row is the one the plan flagged as having **no fixture anywhere** —
`cpp-chain-call/` uses the value `.` form, which already worked. It now has one,
plus the value-dot control that proves the defect was the `->` base specifically.

### PHP: a measured residual, with the trap checked

PHP does **not** resolve yet, and the plan's named trap — a language whose node
type is missing from `extractMixedChain`'s tables reads as "didn't need it" when
it in fact cannot be measured — is **not** the cause. Checked directly against
the emitter:

```
name=save   chain=1|$svc|cgetUser   recv=$svc.getUser()
```

The chain is minted correctly. The residual is that the fold's base, `$svc`,
does not bind in the PHP resolver, so the fold returns `undefined` and the site
falls through to the text cascade. That is PHP binding-key work, not a
chain-layer defect, and it is left as a recorded residual rather than absorbed
into this series.

Two incidental corrections from that check, both to KTD6:

- PHP's receiver capture text is normalized to `$svc.getUser()` — DOTS, not
  `->`. So Case 0's "C-family punctuation" gate fires for PHP after all, which
  is why the call chain was recorded as a VISIBLE-GAP to begin with.
- Typing the fixture parameter (`function f(Service $svc)`) moved the row from
  VISIBLE-GAP to INVISIBLE-GAP: with a type binding the cascade now types the
  receiver but finds no member, so `compoundReceiverUnresolved` is false and no
  drop is recorded. An untyped fixture parameter had been reporting a language
  gap that was really a fixture defect — the same error class as the untyped
  `$repo` control caught earlier.
