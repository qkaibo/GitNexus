/**
 * Build-free scaling + identity bench for the Go, C#, Dart, Ruby (#2877, #2878,
 * #2879, #2880) and Kotlin (#2872) import-target resolvers, over ONE shared
 * corpus so the five are directly comparable.
 *
 * Kotlin also has `bench/kotlin-import-target/`, and this does not replace it:
 * that bench fingerprints both file-set iteration orders and probes the
 * four-tier cascade shape by shape, which this corpus does not. What Kotlin
 * gains here is a second corpus and the arms below that its own bench predates.
 *
 * Before this PR each of the other four answered its lookups with a full
 * `allFilePaths` scan per import, so import resolution cost O(imports × files):
 *
 *   - Go: `findRootPackageFiles` / `findAllFilesInPkgDir`, the latter once per
 *     path segment on the GOPATH fallback — several full scans per import;
 *   - C#: the no-csproj leg took the raw Set past the memoized index the csproj
 *     leg was already using — up to eight passes for a four-segment `using`;
 *   - Dart: one full scan per candidate path, and for an external package both
 *     candidates miss, so both always ran to completion;
 *   - Ruby: a complete `buildSuffixIndex` rebuilt and discarded per `require`.
 *
 * Two properties of the corpus are load-bearing and must not be "simplified":
 *
 *  1. **Most imports are unresolvable.** In real source the majority of imports
 *     name the stdlib or a third-party package, and those run every leg of the
 *     cascade to completion before returning null — the fast paths never fire.
 *     A corpus of mostly-resolving imports measures the wrong half of the
 *     function and would score a reintroduced scan as linear.
 *  2. **Import count scales WITH file count.** The regression is quadratic in
 *     `imports × files`; holding imports fixed while files grow would halve the
 *     exponent and let a per-import scan pass the budget.
 *
 * Reports per language and scale:
 *   - `ms`: fastest of REPS full passes, INCLUDING the one-time index build —
 *     hiding the build would let an index that is itself quadratic pass;
 *   - `scaling_ratio` `(t_large/t_small)/(LARGE/SMALL)`: ~1.0 linear, ~4.x
 *     quadratic at this scale gap;
 *   - `depth_ratio` `t_deep/t_small` at a FIXED file count with ~6x the path
 *     components. `scaling_ratio` divides the file count out, so it is
 *     scale-invariant and structurally cannot see a cost that grows with path
 *     DEPTH instead — and `buildSuffixIndex` (C#, Ruby) and Kotlin's
 *     `suffixByStem` each emit one entry per component. Go and Dart, whose
 *     indexes are depth-free, sit at ~0.9; the others sit legitimately above
 *     1.0, which is why the budget is per language;
 *   - `collide_scaling_ratio`, the same measurement on a corpus whose
 *     directories SHARE their last segment and whose files share basenames —
 *     see the `collide` section below;
 *   - `heap` (C# and Ruby): retained bytes of the shared `WorkspaceFileIndex`
 *     — see the `heap` section below;
 *   - a sha256 over every distinct `fromFile | target → result`, as the
 *     correctness gate. The tie-break-level proof that this PR's index
 *     reproduces the scans lives in
 *     `test/unit/scope-resolution/import-target-index-parity.test.ts`, which
 *     diffs against verbatim copies of the pre-change implementations; this
 *     fingerprint is the forward guard that keeps the output pinned from here.
 *     Every scale's fingerprint is asserted, not just `large`'s: the arms
 *     differ only in layout and padding, so a per-scale-only defect (a resolver
 *     bug that corrupts deep paths, or a corpus edit that quietly deletes the
 *     depth padding) moves no asserted count and would otherwise print PASS.
 *
 * `--check` adds arms that no ratio can carry:
 *   - the corpus SHAPE (files, imports, resolved, distinct outcomes, per scale),
 *     so a future edit cannot quietly shrink the corpus below the sizes that
 *     make the timing arms meaningful and still print PASS. The `deep` and
 *     `collide` arms must also resolve exactly what `small` resolves — padding
 *     and re-layout were supposed to change path depth and directory naming and
 *     nothing else;
 *   - `deep.fingerprint !== small.fingerprint` and
 *     `collide.fingerprint !== small.fingerprint`, so those two arms' EFFECT is
 *     pinned rather than only their output. Both are count-neutral by
 *     construction, so neutering either one (`DEEP_PAD = 0`, a `collideDir`
 *     that forwards to `uniqueDir`) leaves every asserted number untouched;
 *     comparing the arms to `small` is the only thing that notices;
 *   - `small_ms_ceiling` and `collide_ms_ceiling`, ABSOLUTE bounds, because a
 *     constant-factor regression that grows both scale arms equally passes
 *     every ratio.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THE "independent of corpus size" CLAIM — the `collide` arm.
 * `small`/`large`/`deep` mint one directory name per index (`src/pkg7`,
 * `src/Ns7`, `lib/feature7`) and one basename per file, so every index bucket
 * in them holds exactly ONE entry: measured, max last-segment bucket = 1 and
 * max matching directories = 1 for go and csharp at both 400 and 1600 files,
 * max basename bucket = 1 for dart and ruby. Bucket cardinality is the only
 * non-constant term the new indexes have, so those arms certify the headline
 * claim on the one shape where that term cannot appear. `collide` is the same
 * workload — identical file, import and resolved counts — laid out the way
 * these languages are actually written: `svcN/internal/`, `SrcN/Models/`, a
 * `mod0.dart`/`mod0.rb` in every package. Measured on that shape the per-import
 * cost is NOT corpus-size-independent for the three resolvers that scan a
 * bucket:
 *
 *   - go and csharp walk `PackageDirIndex.dirsByLastSegment[seg]`, which now
 *     holds every directory;
 *   - dart walks its basename bucket, which now holds every same-named file;
 *   - ruby and kotlin answer from keyed maps and are collision-IMMUNE, so their
 *     collide budgets are the linear ones — that immunity is the assertion.
 *
 * This is a scope-of-claim limit, not a regression: on the MISS path with a
 * shared leaf name the bucket grows with the file count BY CONSTRUCTION, and
 * the indexed code is still faster there than the pre-change full scan. The arm
 * exists so the real shape is measured and pinned, and so nobody reads the 1.8
 * budget as covering it. Narrowing it would mean a reversed-path prefix-range
 * structure, which trades against the O(files × depth) memory
 * `package-dir-index.ts` cites #2649 to avoid — a design change, not a tune.
 *
 * MEMORY — the `heap` arm. C# and Ruby both resolve through the shared
 * `WorkspaceFileIndex`, and `buildSuffixIndex` under it emits three maps at
 * O(files × depth): exactly the profile `package-dir-index.ts` cites #2649 to
 * avoid for itself. C# is the reason this is gated rather than noted: at BASE
 * `getWorkspaceFileIndex` was reached only from the csproj branch and the
 * no-csproj leg scanned the Set and retained nothing, whereas it is now called
 * unconditionally. Every other arm here is time or count, and no ratio can see
 * a footprint. Measured in ABSOLUTE bytes, not only as a ratio: the finding is
 * about the footprint itself, and a ratio alone hides a large constant.
 *
 * KNOWN BLIND SPOT, measured: a full workspace scan reintroduced on 1-in-32
 * imports passes every arm here (dart scored 1.458 scaling, 1.736 ms). The gate
 * that NARROWS it is not a timing gate — the parity test above counts
 * iterations of the file-set Set and reads 14 instead of 1 for that same
 * mutation. It does not CLOSE it: the counter watches the Set, while the
 * resolvers hold materialized arrays of the same file list
 * (`WorkspaceFileIndex.normalized`/`.all`, Dart's basename buckets,
 * `PackageDirIndex.filesByDir`), and a 1-in-32 scan over one of THOSE passes
 * both the parity test and `--check`. Chasing it by tightening these ceilings
 * toward the noise floor would only buy flaky CI; see `_blind_spot` in
 * baselines.json.
 *
 * Run:
 *   node --expose-gc --import tsx bench/import-target/measure.mjs           # report
 *   node --expose-gc --import tsx bench/import-target/measure.mjs --check   # CI gate
