/**
 * Drop a Windows extended-length (`\\?\`) prefix from a path (#2667).

 * does *not* re-add the prefix for over-MAX_PATH paths, so stripping an
 * filesystem-facing path would break long-path access on hosts that have not
 * opted into `LongPathsEnabled`. Registry keys, repo-resolution lookups and
 * other pure string comparisons are safe — and are exactly where an
 * un-normalized prefix silently fails to match.
 *
 * The prefix can only ever arrive from caller-supplied input (`path.resolve`
 * preserves it); `realpathSync.native` cannot emit it, because libuv's
 * `fs__realpath_handle` strips it unconditionally.
 *
 * `\\?\Volume{GUID}\…` is deliberately left alone: the remainder of a volume-GUID
 * path is not a usable path, so stripping it would invent a wrong one. The `\\.\`
 * device namespace is left alone for the same reason and one more — most of what
 * it addresses (`\\.\PhysicalDrive0`, `\\.\COM1`, `\\.\pipe\…`) is not a
 * filesystem path at all. Both forms simply fail to match a registry entry, which
 * is the safe direction. `platform` is explicit so the transform is unit-testable
 * off Windows — same shape as `normalizeAnalyzerRootPath` in
 * `src/core/analyzer-identity.ts`.
 *
 * Call this on a `path.resolve`d path. Only the backslash spelling is matched,
 * which is sufficient there because `path.win32.resolve` already folds the
 * forward-slash spelling into it (`//?/D:/a` → `\\?\D:\a`). A raw, unresolved
 * `//?/…` string is returned unchanged rather than half-normalized.
