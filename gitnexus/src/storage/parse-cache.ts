/**
 * Chunk-level content-addressed parse cache.
 *
 * The pipeline always parses every file (correctness invariant: cross-file
 * resolution and downstream phases need full graph data). What this cache
 * does is skip the tree-sitter worker dispatch when a chunk's contents
 * haven't changed since the last run.
 *
 * Granularity: chunk-level. The parse phase chunks files into ~20MB byte
 * budgets. The cache key is `sha256(joined(filePath:contentHash for each
 * file in the chunk, sorted))`. A change to a single file invalidates only
 * that file's chunk — typically 1 of ~50 chunks on a 1000-file repo.
 *
 * Why not per-file:
 * - Workers process sub-batches and emit aggregated `ParseWorkerResult`s.
 *   Splitting back to per-file would require reworking the worker contract.
 * - Chunk-level invalidation gives a useful speedup floor (98% on a single
 *   1-of-50 invalidated chunk) without touching the worker.
 *
 * Survives `--force` because it's content-addressed: the same bytes always
 * produce the same key. `--force` only matters for the LadybugDB writeback;
 * the cache itself is always safe to reuse.

// Bumped to 4 in #1983: on-disk parse-cache shards omit legacy DAG fields
// (`calls`, `assignments`, `constructorBindings`) unused after RING4-1 (#942)
// and the worker `parsedFiles` (the worker writes those to the disk ParsedFile
// store instead). #2038 added a DURABLE, content-addressed ParsedFile store
// (`parsedfile-cache/`, see parsedfile-store.ts) keyed by chunk hash that
// mirrors THIS cache's lifecycle — version-gated by PARSE_CACHE_VERSION, pruned
// in lockstep to the surviving keys. On a warm parse-cache hit the chunk's
// ParsedFiles are restored from it, so scope-resolution does NOT re-extract on
// the main thread (the #1983 OOM). Because the two stores share this version,
// any future change to the `ParsedFile` serialization shape MUST bump
// SCHEMA_BUMP so both invalidate in lockstep.
// v35: Java/Kotlin Spring @Bean factory and @Resource side-channel facts
// (#2413). ParsedFile results are content-addressed and replayed verbatim, so
// the feature/schema inventory alone cannot invalidate pre-#2413 captures.
// (Cut as v32 on this branch; `main` took 32 for #2742 and 33/34 for #2747
// first, so this series is renumbered at merge time — see the v21 note.)
// v34: the receiver-chain capture is emitted by ALL 14 language emitters, not
// just TypeScript. v33 landed with the TypeScript-only emission; the rollout to
// the other 13 languages changed the capture set AGAIN, so a cache stamped 33 by
// an intermediate build of that series is not equivalent to one stamped at this
// commit — it would be treated as current while every non-TypeScript file
// replayed pre-rollout captures, leaving the feature silently inert for 13 of 14
// languages. Bumped there so the version tracks the FINAL capture set rather
// than the first divergence.
// v33: TypeScript call matches carry `@reference.receiver-chain`, a compact
// encoding of a receiver that is itself an expression.
// v32: Rust items are qualified by their enclosing `mod` chain (#2742). The
// qualified name is computed in the parse worker, so a warm cache replays the
// old unqualified ids verbatim and the collapse persists.
// v31: Rust `mod_item` gained `@declaration.namespace` and scoped call sites
// gained `@reference.qualified-name` (#2730). Both are PARSE-TIME captures, so a
// warm cache replays the old capture set verbatim: `rawQualifiedName` comes back
// undefined and no Namespace def exists to hang a module prefix on, which turns
// the whole module-qualified resolution tier into a no-op on unchanged files.
// Re-checked against origin/main at commit time per the v29 note below.
// v29: closure-binding declaration rules for PHP/Rust/Kotlin/Ruby/Dart, a Rust
// graph node for `let f = || …`, a Dart closure scope, and function-local VALUES
// (Variable/Const/Property/Static) qualified by their enclosing callable plus
// position (#2699 parts A1 + B). All parse-time, so a warm cache would replay
// the old captures and the pre-qualification ids verbatim.
//
// This is 29 and not 28 because of the exact collision the v21 note below warns
// about: this branch cut at 27 and bumped to 28, while #2415 bumped 27 -> 28 and
// merged FIRST. Re-checking against origin/main at merge time — not at branch
// time — is what caught it; leaving it at 28 would have shipped this change with
// NO parse-cache invalidation, so every warm cache keeps serving the pre-fix
// captures and ids.
// v28: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels persist Spring condition facts and
// annotation-source line numbers (#2415).
// v26: the enclosing-callable walk stops at class bodies and anonymous-class
// construction sites (#2699 follow-up); a v25 cache replays worker results carrying the
// wrong Java anonymous-class ids. Cached results are replayed verbatim — including
// across `--force` — so without this bump a warm cache keeps serving them.
// v25: function-local callables are qualified by their enclosing-callable chain
// plus their own position, and JS/TS gain block scopes (#2699). Both the node
// ids AND the scope tree in a cached worker result are therefore stale. Cached
// results are replayed verbatim — including across `--force` — so without this
// bump a warm cache keeps serving the colliding ids and the block-less scopes.
// v24: function scopes carry `Scope.ownsReceivers`, marking the JS/TS forms
// that bind their own `this` (#2701). The flag lives on the cached `Scope`, so
// without this bump a warm cache replays scopes that lack it and every `this`
// inside an ordinary `function` keeps resolving to the enclosing class —
// verified by probe: `--force` alone does NOT re-derive it.
// v23: closure bindings emit callable nodes in Dart, Ruby, Java, C# and PHP
// (plus JS/TS `var`), and Dart/PHP gain the scope declarations and flow
// captures their forms were missing (#2693). Cached worker results are replayed
// verbatim, so without this bump a warm cache keeps serving the old labels.
// v22: `const X = <arrow | function-expression>` emits one `Function` node
// instead of a `Function` plus an edgeless `Const` twin (#2687). Cached worker
// results are replayed verbatim — including across `--force` — so without this
// bump a warm cache keeps serving the old two-node set.
// v21: TWO changes share this number — a collision, not a typo. #2632
// (Java/Kotlin Spring DI facts: constructor, field/property and method
// injection sites plus bean-name and @Primary provider metadata) bumped 20 -> 21
// and merged first; #2653 (Java local class/enum/record/interface captures using
// javac-compatible, source-type-relative JLS 13.1 identities and
// declaration-to-block scopes, #2562) had branched at 20, bumped to 21 as well,
// and merged second — so it shipped with NO invalidation of its own. An index
// already stamped 21 by the first change was treated as current by the second
// and kept serving stale local-class identities from the warm cache. Harmless
// now (anything below the current value is rejected), and left as-is because
// both genuinely shipped as 21 — renumbering would misstate history. Read this
// as the reason to re-check SCHEMA_BUMP against origin/main immediately before
// merging, not just when the branch is cut; the same collision hit
// the DB schema version in #2653/#2654 (that constant is gone — the DB side is
// a derived fingerprint now, see SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT; SCHEMA_BUMP below is still
// hand-maintained because no declarative artifact describes a capture set).
// v27: generator EXPRESSIONS bound to a name emit a callable definition capture,
// and nested-callable caller attribution appends the localIdentity suffix the
// definition phase already used. Both are parse-time, so a warm cache would
// otherwise replay the old captures and ids verbatim.
// v30/schema v22: CommonJS export capture emission (#2723) — new @definition/@declaration
// captures for exports.X, aliased receivers, module-level `this`, re-export
// forwarding and `module.exports = fn`, plus prototype/`this` Methods. A warm
// cache would otherwise replay the pre-fix captures verbatim.
// v20: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels persist package and class-annotation
// facts for shared Spring Bean resolution.
// v19: Java enum constant bodies emit E$N Class nodes; anonymous naming uses
// JLS 13.1 immediate-host chains (#2555).
// v18: Worker$N anonymous bodies. v17: callable-value-flow operand identity.
// v16: direct callee identity.
// v36: bound-callable graph `startLine` follows the initializer so multi-line
// closure bindings join the scope channel (#2735). Warm cache would otherwise
// keep serving wrapper-line startLines and drop the CALLS edge.
// v37: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels include Spring AOP owner/advice facts
// (#2416). Warm cache entries at v36 do not carry those facts and would silently
// omit ADVISED_BY evidence.
// v38: Swift nested conditional-compilation directives are blanked before the
// parse (#2771), so a class body that previously error-recovered away now
// survives. The chunk key hashes raw on-disk bytes and `preprocessSource` runs
// after it is computed, so unchanged Swift files would otherwise replay their
// pre-fix `ParseWorkerResult` verbatim — including across `--force`. Allocated
// on `main`, NOT by this branch — kept so the number is not reused a third time.
// v39: receiver-chain wire format v2 — the encoded chain gained name-free
// `await` and `index` step kinds, so the VERSION prefix moved 1 -> 2 and every
// persisted chain string changed. A v2 decoder REFUSES a v1 payload (that is
// the point: a chain missing its await or index hop decodes cleanly as a
// different, shorter chain and would type the receiver against the wrong
// member), so a stale cache replays chains this build silently discards —
// the feature degrades to the text cascade with no error anywhere. Bumped so
// the stale cache is rejected rather than half-read.
//
// NUMBERED 39, AFTER TWO REALLOCATIONS. This branch first used 37; `main` took
// 37 for Spring AOP (#2416) mid-flight, so it moved to 38; `main` then took 38
// for the Swift directive fix (#2771), landing on the branch's number AGAIN.
// That is the EIGHTH collision in this series and the SECOND exact clash — two
// incompatible schemas claiming one number, twice running. The lesson is not
// "pick a bigger number": it is that the check must happen immediately before
// merge, because the window between review and merge is exactly when `main`
// allocates. Re-check against origin/main before merging this.
// v40: inference-typed class fields emit type-binding captures in SIX languages
// (#2807) — TypeScript/JavaScript `public_field_definition|field_definition` with a
// `new_expression` value and `this.<field> = new X()`; Python `self.x = Outer()`;
// Ruby `@ivar = Foo.new`; Swift optional property annotations; Dart inferred-type
// and final field declarations plus constructor-body field writes. Every one of
// these is PARSE-TIME capture emission, so a warm cache replays the pre-fix
// capture set verbatim for byte-unchanged files and the new receiver edges never
// appear — silently, with no error, exactly the v27/v30 failure mode. `analyze`
// skips tree-sitter dispatch for unchanged chunks (GUARDRAILS.md), so a plain
// re-analyze does NOT surface them without this bump.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING — main was also at 39
// when this was allocated, and this file records eight prior collisions.
// v41: the v40 Dart field-write binding gained its READ-side mask (#2807 review)
// — a Dart class-member body that rebinds one of its class's field names now
// emits `@receiver-owner.shadowed-fields` on its synthesized `@scope.function`
// match, which becomes `Scope.ownsReceivers`. Parse-time capture emission again,
// so a v40 warm cache replays scope matches with no marker and the receiver walk
// still reaches the class field — i.e. it keeps serving the WRONG edge this
// bump's fix removes, silently. Same bump-or-nothing situation as v40.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// v42: the v40/v41 Python constructor-field arm stopped accepting a DOTTED
// callee (#2807 review). `self.svc = f.Alpha()` no longer emits a
// `@type-binding.constructor` capture at all, which is what removes the
// fabricated edge to the same-named class `Alpha` and what stops
// `self.conn = Registry.get()` displacing an earlier real `self.conn = Outer()`.
// A within-PR re-bump, not a collision fix: v41 was allocated by this same
// unmerged branch, so v41-stamped caches exist only on it — but they exist on
// every reviewer's and CI runner's checkout of it, and parse-time emission means
// they replay the pre-fix capture set for byte-unchanged files and keep serving
// the fabricated edge. main is at 39, so 40/41/42 are all this branch's.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// v43: Go embedded fields now emit `@reference.embedded-pointer` when written
// as `*T` rather than `T` (#2813 exact method sets). Go's method-set rules make
// the two forms genuinely different — `struct{ Base }` does NOT get Base's
// pointer-receiver methods in its value method set while `struct{ *Base }` does
// — so structural interface satisfaction cannot be exact without the spelling.
// This is PARSE-TIME capture emission, so a warm cache replays the pre-fix
// capture set for byte-unchanged files and the distinction never appears:
// silently, with no error, the v27/v30 failure mode. `analyze` skips tree-sitter
// dispatch for unchanged chunks (GUARDRAILS.md), so a plain re-analyze does NOT
// surface it without this bump.
//
// 42 -> 43: this branch originally allocated 43 while sitting at 39, because
// main had already taken 40/41/42 for #2807. main has since merged those and
// this branch rebased onto it, so 43 remains the next free number and the
// value is unchanged by the rebase — the reason it was chosen is simply now
// visible in the history above. RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY
// BEFORE MERGING; this file records eight prior collisions, two EXACT.
