/**
 * "Which files live DIRECTLY inside a directory whose path ends with
 * `<pkgPath>`?" — the query Go's package resolution and C#'s namespace-directory
 * fallback both answered with a full `allFilePaths` scan per import.
 *
 * Both scans ran the same predicate: normalize to forward slashes, apply the
 * language's extension filter, find the FIRST `'/' + pkgPath + '/'` occurrence,
 * and keep the file only if nothing after that occurrence contains a slash.
 *
 * That predicate depends only on the file's DIRECTORY, so it can be answered
 * from an index built once per file set:
 *
 *   let D = '/' + <normalized dir of the file> + '/'
 *   let P = '/' + pkgPath + '/'
 *   match ⟺ D.length >= P.length && D.indexOf(P) === D.length - P.length
 *
 * The right-hand side says two things at once, and BOTH are load-bearing:
 *  1. `D` ends with `P` — the file's directory ends with `pkgPath`;
 *  2. that trailing occurrence is the FIRST one — so `a/pkg/b/pkg/x.go` does
 *     NOT answer `pkg`, because the original `indexOf` found the earlier `/pkg/`
 *     and `b/pkg/x.go` still contained a slash. Dropping condition 2 looks like
 *     a cleanup and moves edges in every repository that nests a directory name
 *     inside itself (`internal/…/internal`, `Models/…/Models`).
 *
 * Candidates are narrowed by the directory's LAST segment rather than by
 * indexing every directory suffix: a suffix map costs O(files × depth) entries,
 * which is exactly the memory this codebase runs out of at kernel scale
 * (#2649), while the last-segment bucket is O(directories) and is a superset of
 * the matches (`D` ends with `P` ⟹ the dir's last segment is `pkgPath`'s last
 * segment).
 *
 * Results keep Set-iteration order via the recorded `ord`, because the callers'
 * scans emitted in that order and Go returns the whole list as the import
 * target (one `ImportEdge` per file).
 *
 * Each language owns its own `WeakMap` memo and `accept` predicate, so the
 * STORED index holds only that language's files — the build pass itself still
 * walks every path it is handed once per language. That is not a polyglot tax
 * in practice: `scope-resolution/pipeline/run.ts:673` rebuilds `allFilePaths`
 * from the provider's own `parsedFiles`, so the set already contains only that
 * language's files.
