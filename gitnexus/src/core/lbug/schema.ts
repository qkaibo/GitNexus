 *
 * Imported from the ingestion layer, NOT re-listed here: a hand-copied twin is
 * pure drift risk, since a label added to it (or dropped from the original) is
 * invisible to every guard. `csv-generator.ts` and `lbug-adapter.ts`, both
 * siblings in this directory, already import from `../ingestion/`.
 *
 * The cost is that importing this module pulls five ingestion modules into the
 * runtime closure. `gitnexus-web` does not depend on this package at all (only
 * on `gitnexus-shared`), so nothing here reaches a browser bundle. The MCP
 * server still pays it, though: `local-backend.ts` no longer imports this
 * module directly (its two embedding constants come from `gitnexus-shared`),
 * but pool-adapter -> lbug-adapter -> csv-generator reaches it anyway.

 * own node id, and C# `Delegate` is in that set without being linkable.
 *
 * Both sets are `NodeLabel`-typed rather than `NodeTableName`-typed because
 * that is what the originals carry, and `NodeLabel` is the wider union — it
 * admits five labels with no node table (`Project`, `Package`, `Decorator`,
 * `Import`, `Type`). A label from that gap would emit DDL naming a table that

 * `DECLARATIVES`), `Class→Tool` (`@mcp.tool()` on a class). Declaring
 * {@link DEFINITION_ANCHOR_LABELS} × this set covers all four plus every
 * sibling the same emitters can reach.
 *
 * TWO TARGETS ARE LABEL-GATED TODAY, and the cross product over-declares for
 * them ON PURPOSE (~47 of the 182 attachment pairs are unreachable right now):
 *  - `Community` — `isCommunitySymbol` (`community-processor.ts`) admits only
 *    `Function` / `Class` / `Method` / `Interface` as members, so the other 22
 *    anchors cannot source a MEMBER_OF edge until that predicate widens.
 *  - `Route` — HANDLES_ROUTE sources `generateId('File', handlerPath)`, a
 *    literal `File`, so every non-`File` anchor is headroom.
 *
 * Those pairs stay declared because the two sides of the error are not
 * symmetric: an UNDECLARED pair makes LadybugDB reject the edge and aborts
 * `analyze` outright on a user's repo, while an unused DECLARED pair costs
 * almost nothing — `bench/schema-pairs` measures the whole 332→450 growth
 * (118 pairs, of which these ~47 are a part) at 0.93–1.05×, i.e. inside
 * run-to-run noise.
 * Every one of the four aborts above came from re-narrowing a set to what one
 * predicate looked like it allowed — so a reading of `isCommunitySymbol` is not
 * grounds to shrink this. Widening either predicate is then a no-op here.
 *
 * `Route` / `Tool` being excluded as ANCHORS (see {@link NON_DEFINITION_LABELS})
 * is likewise a SIZE choice, not something derived from a rule: they do source
 * `ENTRY_POINT_OF`, and admitting them would mint twelve further pairs no
 * emitter can currently reach.
 *
 * Sized deliberately: this rule brings the DDL to 450 pairs. `bench/schema-pairs`
 * measures it against real `@ladybugdb/core` with identical data — untyped-endpoint
 * anchored queries (`MATCH (a {id: $id})-[r:CodeRelation]->(b)`, the shape
 * `impact` / `context` / `detect_changes` issue), relative to the 332-pair
 * hand-list this replaced. Four runs on the same box:
 *
 *   450 → 0.93–1.05×   641 → 1.22–1.43×   786 → 1.52–1.75×   1024 → 2.03–2.34×
 *
 * 450 is inside run-to-run noise (it came out FASTER than 332 on three of the
 * four runs); everything past ~640 is not. The knee sits just above 450, so the containment half below
 * stays hand-declared rather than being folded into a third cross product.
 * Re-run that bench and quote the range — not one run — before proposing one.

 *
 * What survives here is characteristic, not arbitrary. Almost all of it is a

 * `SCOPE_BRIDGE_TARGET_LABELS` nor {@link ATTACHMENT_TARGET_LABELS} — plus the

 * substrate.
 *
 * NOTHING A RULE ALREADY COVERS BELONGS HERE. `generatedRelationPairs` skips
 * any pair present in this block, so a redundant line does not merely duplicate
 * — it SUPPRESSES generation, and later narrowing a rule would silently keep
 * that pair alive with no test failing. 161 such lines were deleted from this
 * block (the DDL's pair set is unchanged: they moved into the generated half);
 * `test/unit/schema-pair-coverage.test.ts` now fails if one comes back.
 *
 * Folding this remainder into a third cross product
 * (`DEFINITION_ANCHOR_LABELS × {CodeElement, Section, Typedef, Union,
 * Namespace, Impl, TypeAlias, Static, Template}`) would take the table to 641
 * pairs and leave only ~29 lines here. `bench/schema-pairs` measures 641 at
 * 1.22–1.43× on anchored queries, where production's 450 is inside noise — so
 * that trade buys ~43 fewer hand-written lines for a real ~22–43% on the query
 * shape `impact` uses, which is why it is deferred rather than taken.
 *
 * Exported so `test/unit/schema-pair-coverage.test.ts` can subtract it and
 * assert the GENERATED region of the DDL for exact equality against the two
 * rules, rather than one-directional containment.
 * `test/integration/structural-pair-coverage.test.ts` guards this half from a
